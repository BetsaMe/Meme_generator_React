# Meme generator app in React

This meme generator app is part of the free React course at Scrimba. https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact

Live demo: https://super-zuccutto-04a2bf.netlify.app

The app works by pulling a random meme image from an API and placing your text over it to create your own custom meme.
